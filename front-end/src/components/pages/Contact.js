                        I am a web developer, recently moved over from management at Panera. I am passionate about solving problems in creative and efficient ways, while making ergonomic and enjoyable websites. Code can be 
                        complex, and solving coding issues aren't the only problem. Making code that others can readily read and understand is critical to contributing to a part of any team. I care about my friends and family, 
                        helping to lead worship at my church, my girlfriend Emily, and many other things. I can be found spending time with friends at the park or cooking out with my roommates. I love the marvel cinematic universe
                        and the comics that brought them about. I've read all the Harry Potters, LOTR, the Ender Saga, the Chronicles of Narnia, and other series and books.
